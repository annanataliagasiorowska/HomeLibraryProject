#HomeLibrary Project

## General description
Solution to keep our big family library under control. 
It will help us find the book we want to read or check if it is
already in our library. If someone wants to buy us book as a gift, 
he could check if it won't be a repetition.
The project summarizes first part of my CodeCool programming course, but it's 
my own idea, and it's not prepared within the course.
